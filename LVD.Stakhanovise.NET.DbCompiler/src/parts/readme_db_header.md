# Stakhanovise.NET Database Assets

Stakhanovise.NET relies on a couple of database assets to get the job done. 
You can find a script with all the required definitions [over here](https://github.com/alexboia/Stakhanovise.NET/blob/master/_Db/stakhanovise_db_scripts.sql) and their description right below.
Also, you don't actually have to set them up your self - the library will make sure everying is in place, 
but you can disable this behaviour if it doesn't suite your needs.
